This is a little project to teach programming skills as well as basic AI.
For now you can play with the DummyBrain in brain.py or implement your own.
Import it in main.py and hook it up to BRAIN1 or BRAIN2 to run it.

TODO:
add tank weapons / damage
add explosions and other animations
add GUI elements like victory screen, etc

Requirements:
Python 2.7+ http://www.python.org/
Pyglet: http://pyglet.org/
  note for OSX users: you'll need a special version of Pyglet for 64bit Python. I've uploaded an egg on https://github.com/mathom/BrainTank/downloads for you to use.

The code is GPLv3, but the art is not.
