This is a little project to teach programming skills as well as basic AI.
For now you can play with the DummyBrain in brain.py or implement your own.

How to make brains:
Copy brains/wander.py to brains/yourname.py and add "yourname" it to config.py.
For now it will only read the first two brains listed...

TODO:
add tank weapons / damage
add explosions and other animations
add GUI elements like victory screen, etc

Requirements:
Python 2.7+ http://www.python.org/
Pyglet: http://pyglet.org/
  note for OSX users: you'll need a special version of Pyglet for 64bit Python. I've uploaded an egg on https://github.com/mathom/BrainTank/downloads for you to use.

The code is GPLv3, but the art is not.
